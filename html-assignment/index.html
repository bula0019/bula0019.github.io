                <p>Hello! My name is Hananh Bula. I am a student of Interactive Media Design in <abbr

            <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
            <p>I am originally from the Philippines, a beautiful country located in Asia. Moving to Canada was one
                of
                the
                biggest decisions my parents had to make in order to give us a better life with full of
                opportunities
                ahead
                of us. Living in a new country has forced me to step outside of my comfort zone and has taught me
                how to
                stand on my own. It has been both exciting and challenging, but I am grateful for the experiences
                and
                growth
                it has brought me.</p>
            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            <p>At the moment, I am able to travel and actually do what I've been wanting to do since I was a child
                because
                of the freedom it offers. Allowing me to learn how to appreciate the smallest things that life can
                offer, by
                living with a wider perspective. <em>Travelling has reminded me of how far I've come at such a
                    young
                    age
                    and
                    how
                    much more I still have to see.</em></p>
