        <p>Hello! My name is Hananh Bula. I am a student of Interactive Media Design in Algonquin College.</p>

        <p>I am originally from the Philippines, a beautiful country located in Asia. Moving to Canada was one of the
            biggest decisions my parents had to make in order to give us a better life with full of opportunities ahead
            of us. Living in a new country has forced me to step outside of my comfort zone and has taught me how to
            stand on my own. It has been both exciting and challenging, but I am grateful for the experiences and growth
            it has brought me.</p>
        <p>At the moment, I am able to travel and actually do what I've been wanting to do since I was a child because
            of the freedom it offers. Allowing me to learn how to appreciate the smallest things that life can offer, by
            living with a wider perpective. <em>Travelling has reminded me of how far I've come at such a young age and
                how
                much more I still have to see.</em></p>
